# Hello, I'm Duarte Santos ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’¼ I am currently working as an **AppSec Analyst** for **Checkmarx**.

ðŸŽ“ In December 2022, I completed my **Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering**, specializing in the exciting fields of **Cybersecurity** and **AI**.

ðŸš© Although I still have a lot to learn, I enjoy taking part in **Capture The Flag** (CTF) competitions as a proud member of team **STT**.

.

I have also written a dissertation on **Automatic Program Repair**, but unfortunately, the code cannot yet be publicly shared.

Most of my projects are in private repositories, but feel free to contact me if you'd like access to any of them.

.

Thanks for stopping by!
