## Hello, I'm Duarte Santos ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering, specialized in Cybersecurity and AI.

Most of my university projects are in private repositories, but feel free to contact me if you'd like access to any of them. I've also written a dissertation on Automatic Program Repair, but the code is not yet ready for public sharing.

Thanks for stopping by!
