# Hello, I'm Duarte Santos ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’¼ I am currently working as an **Security Testing Engineer** for Blip (part of the **Flutter Entertainment Group**). In the past I was an *AppSec Analyst* at *Checkmarx*.

ðŸŽ“ In December 2022, I completed my **Master's degree** in *Computer Science and Engineering* at *Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico*. My dissertation focused on *Automatic Program Repair*.

.

Although I still have a lot to learn, I sometimes take part in *Capture The Flag* (CTF) competitions as a proud member of team **STT**.

.

In my spare time I like to go bouldering and I'm also learning to play the drums.

Thanks for stopping by!
